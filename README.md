# DMV Restaurants Database
# For INST327 Database Modelling and Design at the University of Maryland

This is a test database of restaurants in the DMV area. We began to build the database by figuring out what tables we wanted to be featured. You can take a sneak peek at the tables in the file titled "team_4_restaurants_logical.png". 

Then we created some sample data. This data lists real restaurants with fictitious reviews, customer information, and restaurant vending companies. After, we brainstormed a few possible queries that could be used on the database and turned them into views.

My personal contributions went as follows:

- ER Diagram: 
I established the relationship between the different tables in our database and forward engineered the final relationship to build database skeleton. 

- Code Editor:
I worked with my team to write SQL code and implement formatting requirements to meet project deliverables.

- Data Collection: 
I browsed the internet for restaurants in Maryland and Washington,and manually filled in csv files that were later imported into our database. We decided to collect our data manually because we had a relatively small limit size given by our professor and our needed data couldn't be scraped from just one webpage. Also some of our data wasn't provided by the restaurants and had to be made up.

You may read more about the process of designing the database in the written report titled "team_4_restaurants_report.pdf".
